Hello! I am a PhD candidate in economics at [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/), where I am supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program). I do research in behavioral and labor economics, with a focus on the digital economy. 

I graduated from MIT in 2019 with an SB in mathematical economics and chemical-biological engineering. Before my PhD, I did research in genoeconomics at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/). 

Outside of economics, my interests include running to cafes, drinking matcha lattes, sampling hot sauces, playing violin, and listening to pop trash.
